            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm a dedicated Computer Science major with a passion for software engineering and coding, on track to graduate in the next three semesters. Over the past two years, I've honed my skills in a variety of programming languages and technologies. Python, AI, and data structures hold a special place in my skillset, but my experiences also span to website design, Java, HTML, CSS, C++, C, and computer operating systems like Ubuntu and VMware.</p>

                <p>My academic journey has been complemented by several hands-on projects, where I often found myself naturally stepping into leadership roles. These experiences have cemented my belief in collaboration, ensuring not just the completion of tasks but their execution to the highest standard. This drive stems from a combination of my genuine love for coding and the soft skills I've developed during my time as a server at a bustling restaurant. Serving a diverse range of people has honed my interpersonal skills, and I take pride in my ability to get along effortlessly with everyone I meet.</p>
                
                <p>Outside the coding realm, I'm an avid video game enthusiast. Not just playing them, but also diving deep into their architectureâ€”hacking and scripting them, to be precise. This hobby has given me a unique perspective on software and a dream to one day code for the gaming industry. When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you can find me either watching or playing sports, or spending quality time with family and friends.</p>
            
                <p>As I approach the culmination of my academic pursuits, my excitement to join the vast universe of software engineering intensifies. I am driven by the desire to innovate, develop, and contribute to diverse areas of technology. While I harbor a special fondness for the gaming sector and its endless possibilities, my ambitions are not limited. I aim to leverage my varied skill set across multiple domains, constantly seeking challenges that push my boundaries. Each hurdle I've crossed, be it decoding a perplexing algorithm or steering a team project to success, fortifies my foundation and shapes my vision for the future.</p>
